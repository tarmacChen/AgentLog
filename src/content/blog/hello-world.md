## Welcome to AgentLog

This is the beginning of **AgentLog** — a place to document experiments, observations, and learnings about AI agents.

### What to expect

- Notes on building and deploying AI agents
- Patterns that work (and ones that don't)
- Tool integrations and automation experiments
- Reflections on working alongside AI in day-to-day engineering

### Why "AgentLog"?

The name is intentionally plain. This is a log — a running record of what happens when you work closely with AI agents over time. Less manifesto, more field notes.

Stay tuned.
